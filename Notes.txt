For migrations, you need dotnet ef ( dotnet entity framework cli )

# Run
dotnet ef ( if this throws an error, you need to download it, RUN -> dotnet tool install --global dotnet-e )

# Run
dotnet restore

# Run ( if you are in the project folder, where CityInfoDBMigration is the name of the migration description )
dotnet ef migrations add CityInfoDBMigration

# OR Run ( if you outside the project folder, this worked for me )
dotnet ef migrations add CityInfoDBMigration -p CityInfo.API

# I ran this to bundle the migration, not sure this is needed to apply a migration
dotnet ef migrations bundle -p CityInfo.API -v

# If you get an error on the above, run and then rebundle if you need to
dotnet restore -r osx-arm64

$ To run the migration
dotnet ef database update
